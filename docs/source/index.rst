Harmonica
=========

Harmonica is a python package for computing transit light curves of
different shaped occultors. The primary utility of this code is for
mapping exoplanet atmospheres around their terminators, however the
technique can be applied to any transit light curve to derive the shape
of the transiting body. Be sure to have a quick read through of how the
shapes, referred to as :doc:`transmission strings <views/transmission_strings>`,
are defined before you get going.
